SkyLang is a programming language meant for AbleOS. Currently, ironically, it only works on Linux. It is written in Rust, and we are planning to self-host. Anyways, here's a code example:

``` skylang
let able = 100;
let os = 100;
fnaf adder(a, b) {
	return a + b;
}

assert_eq(200, adder(able, os));
```
